Introduction
============
These are Plain Old Bash (POB) Recipes which could be used from RemotoIT (https://github.com/nestoru/remoto-it) to setup hadoop components. 

Look into common/hadoop/hadoop-constants and common/hadoop/hadoop-preconditions for customizations.

It might contain some useful bash recipes for other type of servers as well. So the idea with this project is just to present a proof of concept for the use of remoto-it to configure servers from POB.
