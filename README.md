Introduction
============
These are Plain Old Bash (POB) Recipes which could be used from RemotoIT (https://github.com/nestoru/remoto-it) to perform server configuration tasks. For example I show how to setup hadoop components. 

Look into common/hadoop/hadoop-constants and common/hadoop/hadoop-preconditions for customizations.

It also contains useful bash recipes for other services as well.
